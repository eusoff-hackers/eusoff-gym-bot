## Requirements

To use this, you'll need.

1. [Telegram bot Token](https://core.telegram.org/bots)
2. [A google account](https://script.google.com/home)
3. [Spreadsheet IDs](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts#spreadsheet_id) to the necessary in google sheet format (upload [files from this folder](sheets) to google drive and convert to google sheets files through `File > Save as Google Sheets`) Furthermore, create an empty spreadsheet to be used as a logsheet for logger!

## Installation

1. With [npm](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) installed, install [clasp](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp) globally

   ```bash
   npm install -g @google/clasp
   ```

2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
3. Enable the [Google Apps Script API](https://script.google.com/home/usersettings)
4. Then login to Google, `clasp login`
5. Create the google app, `clasp create --title "Eusoff Gym Bot" --type webapp --rootDir src`
6. Copy `config.js.example` into `config.js`, replace all placeholder values with your own, except for deployment id.
7. Deploy it using `clasp deploy` to get the deployment id.

   Take note of the deployment id after `Created version x` e.g.

   ```
   Created version 1.
   - <<YOUR DEPLOYMENT ID HERE>> @1.
   ```

8. Now set the deployment id in `secret.js` along with the bot token and sheet ids.
9. Run `clasp push` and `clasp deploy -i <<YOUR DEPLOYMENT ID HERE>>` to push your code to Google Scripts and deploy it again
10. Run `clasp open` to open it in google script
11. Click `config.js`, and click `Run > Run Function > setWebHook`
12. It will ask you to authorise (for the first time), and it should be ok to do so, click `Advanced > Go to Eusoff Gym Bot (unsafe) > Allow`

13. Open the app by `clasp open --webapp`, select the version with your deployment id to open. (This will automatically reset the telegram bot's webhooks)

## Tips

- When you want to update your telegram bot with the current code, use `clasp push && clasp deploy -i <<YOUR DEPLOYMENT ID>>`
